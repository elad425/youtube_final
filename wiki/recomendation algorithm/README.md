# Viewing videos in the react app on user1.

1. We login to user1 and start by watching "7 ways to deal with css".

3. We then view "itay-keren peles".

   ![3](../pics/58.jpg)

4. We then view "argentina vs france", overall meaning those 4 videos have been watched together, meaning for any one of those videos if we watch one of them we should get recommended the others first.
